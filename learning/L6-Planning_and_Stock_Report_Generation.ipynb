      "4. **Visualizations**: Create a line graph to visualize the stock price trend over the past month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start with step 1: Retrieving historical stock price data for NVIDIA.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 1: Retrieve Historical Stock Price Data\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use Python libraries like `yfinance` to fetch the required data. Here's the code to do that:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import yfinance as yf\n",
      "import pandas as pd\n",
      "\n",

      "# Fetch historical data\n",
      "nvidia_stock = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Display the data\n",
      "print(nvidia_stock)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Run this code to retrieve the historical stock price data for NVIDIA. Once you have the data, we can proceed to step 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Calculate Summary Statistics\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the data is retrieved, we will calculate the summary statistics:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Calculate summary statistics\n",
      "open_price = nvidia_stock['Open'].iloc[0]\n",
      "close_price = nvidia_stock['Close'].iloc[-1]\n",
      "high_price = nvidia_stock['High'].max()\n",
      "low_price = nvidia_stock['Low'].min()\n",
      "percentage_change = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100\n",
      "\n",
      "# Display the summary statistics\n",
      "summary_statistics = {\n",
      "    \"Open Price\": open_price,\n",
      "    \"Close Price\": close_price,\n",

      "\n",
      "Run this code to calculate and display the summary statistics. Once we have the summary statistics, we can proceed to step 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Gather Market Trends (Optional)\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use Python libraries like `requests` or `BeautifulSoup` to scrape news articles or market trends related to NVIDIA from financial websites. Here's an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import requests\n",
      "from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n",
      "\n",
      "# Define the URL for financial news\n",
      "url = \"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/news\"\n",
      "\n",
      "# Send a request to the URL\n",
      "response = requests.get(url)\n",
      "soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n",
      "\n",
      "# Find and extract news headlines\n",
      "news_headlines = []\n",
      "for article in soup.find_all('h3', class_='Mb(5px)'):\n",
      "    headline = article.text.strip()\n",
      "    news_headlines.append(headline)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Display the news headlines\n",
      "print(news_headlines)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Run this code to gather and display recent news headlines related to NVIDIA. Once we have the market trends, we can proceed to step 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Create Visualizations\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we will create a line graph to visualize the stock price trend over the past month:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
      "\n",
      "# Plot the stock prices\n",
      "plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n",
      "plt.plot(nvidia_stock.index, nvidia_stock['Close'], label='NVDA Closing Price', color='blue')\n",
      "plt.title('NVIDIA Stock Price Performance (2024-03-25 to 2024-04-23)')\n",
      "plt.xlabel('Date')\n",
      "plt.ylabel('Price (USD)')\n",

      "Run this code to retrieve the historical stock price data for NVIDIA. Once you have the data, we can proceed to step 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Calculate Summary Statistics\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the data is retrieved, we will calculate the summary statistics:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Calculate summary statistics\n",
      "open_price = nvidia_stock['Open'].iloc[0]\n",

      "low_price = nvidia_stock['Low'].min()\n",

      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Gather Market Trends (Optional)\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use Python libraries like `requests` or `BeautifulSoup` to scrape news articles or market trends related to NVIDIA from financial websites. Here's an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",

      "\n",
      "Run this code to gather and display recent news headlines related to NVIDIA. Once we have the market trends, we can proceed to step 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Create Visualizations\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we will create a line graph to visualize the stock price trend over the past month:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
      "\n",
      "# Plot the stock prices\n",
